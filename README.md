## Firmware
Originally (Â°2017), a Digistump clone was used.  Unfortunately, the USB-enumeration wasn't as reliable as expected, so it has been replaced by an Adafruit Trinket M0.
The PlatformIO code supports both.
## Software
Python code is used to generate speech based on the upcoming events in an Outlook calendar.  The Raspberry Pi (or a PC) runs the Python code.
